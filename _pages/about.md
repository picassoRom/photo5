My website, where my website is a website...clear no? Welcome!

My name is Antonio Lioi and I am based in Turin, Italy. 

**THE IDEA** behind the project is to spread...ideas, colors, art and thoughts.

Personally my passion lies in *street and landscape photography*, where I like to find stories and special moments in everyday scenarios. 

In this website you'll find also a section called [Friends/Artists](https://picassorom.github.io/photo5/Friends_Artists/). This area is dedicated, as the name says, to some *friends* which are also very talented **Artists** that I consider worthy of being discovered.
